Healthcare Translation & Transcription Backend

This is the backend for a healthcare translation and transcription web application. It is built using FastAPI and integrates with the MyMemory Translation API to provide real-time translation services. The backend exposes an API endpoint that accepts text and a target language, translates the text, and returns the result.
